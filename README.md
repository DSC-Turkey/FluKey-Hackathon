# FluKey-Hackathon Project
While creating the project idea, we thought about how we could bring together both people who want to help and people in need. Our practice aims to increase the education level of societies while fighting poverty. Our application aims to donate more than 90% of the income obtained here to people in need by selling the tickets of these events at an affordable price with volunteer events organized by people who are experienced in their field. In addition, it aims to give tickets to people who want to participate in these events but do not have a condition, and these people will also benefit from the events.
